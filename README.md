GigSync – Connecting Vendors and Gig Workers
🧩 Overview

GigSync is a platform that bridges the gap between vendors and gig workers by enabling secure, skill-based matching, verified identities, and transparent payments. It aims to empower India’s informal workforce by offering digital credibility and fair opportunities through verified profiles and AI-assisted matching.

🚀 Problem Statement

In India’s gig economy, many workers lack verified digital credentials, have limited digital literacy, and rely on informal networks to find jobs. This leads to:

Unfair pay and exploitation.

Lack of verified skill records.

No central platform for job–skill matching.

Distrust between vendors and workers.

💡 Solution

GigSync solves these problems by:

Using DigiLocker API for free, government-verified digital identity and skill certificates.

Creating a matching algorithm that connects vendors and workers based on skills, location, ratings, and past performance.

Providing verified badges and trust scores for both vendors and workers.

Offering transparent payment tracking and in-app chat support for project updates.
